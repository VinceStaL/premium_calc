can you please read our chat history @q-dev-chat-2025-06-02-debug.mdÂ and this time I want to use the business files, I have loaded these files to the correct folder. I am using the date range that you suggested to test, e.g. "effectiveDate": "2023-12-01", but I got below errors:

Yes, I'd like to continue helping you debug the issue with the business files. Let me summarize what we've found so far and suggest next steps.

Based on our investigation:

1. The error message shows that the API can't find a base rate for product code H0A, even though our debug scripts confirmed that H0A exists in the ProductRateMaster.xlsx file.

2. We've fixed the date format in the Excel files to use human-readable dates (2023-01-01 to 2099-12-31) instead of Excel serial numbers.

3. We've generated new sample data with the correct date ranges and product codes.

4. We're having trouble connecting to the server to test our changes.

Let's try a different approach:

1. First, let's make sure the server is running properly. You'll need to start the server manually:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\jxv\OneDrive - The Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia Limited\Sync\Dev\test03_bolt\api
   node server.js
   ```

2. Once the server is running, open a new command prompt and run:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\jxv\OneDrive - The Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia Limited\Sync\Dev\test03_bolt\api
   node testRequest.js
   ```

3. If you're still getting the "No base rate found for product code H0A" error, try accessing the debug endpoint directly in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/debug-product/H0A?date=2023-12-01
   ```

The key issue appears to be that the data is loaded correctly (as we confirmed with our debug scripts), but something is going wrong during the lookup process. The most likely causes are:

1. Date format inconsistency - The dates in the Excel files might be stored differently than what the application expects
2. Case sensitivity - The product code lookup might be case-sensitive
3. Data type issues - The rate code might be stored as a number but compared as a string

Let me know if you're able to start the server and what results you get from the debug endpoint. That will help us narrow down the issue further.

when I run node testRequest.js I got a success response:

}

Great! The API is now working correctly with the business files. The response shows that it successfully found the product H0A and calculated the premium.

Let's summarize what we did to fix the issue:

1. We identified that the dates in the business Excel files were in Excel serial number format, which was causing issues with date comparison in the application.

2. We created and ran `fixDatesReadable.js` to convert the dates to human-readable format (2023-01-01 to 2099-12-31).

3. We generated new sample data with the correct date ranges using `generateSampleData.js`.

4. We updated the test request to use the correct date (2023-12-01) that falls within the valid date range.

The key issue was the date format in the Excel files. By converting them to a consistent human-readable format that the application could properly parse and compare, we resolved the "No base rate found" error.

Now that the API is working correctly, you can use the business files without any issues. The premium calculation is returning the expected result with a base premium of 286.8 for product code H0A.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help with regarding this issue?
