Based on my analysis of the project, I now have a comprehensive understanding of this Premium Calculator application. Let me summarize what this project is:

## Premium Calculator Application Overview

This is a **health insurance premium calculation system** built with a modern web architecture. Here's what the project does:

### **Core Purpose**
- Calculates health insurance premiums based on various factors like product type, state, coverage scale, payment frequency, age, gender, and rebates
- Serves as a business tool for insurance companies to determine premium costs for different insurance products

### **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express API with Swagger documentation
- **Data Storage**: Excel files (.xlsx) instead of traditional database
- **Deployment**: Dockerized with multi-platform support

### **Key Features**

1. **Premium Calculation Engine**
   - Supports 4 product codes: H0A, HA0, AML, BML
   - Multiple payment frequencies (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.)
   - State-based pricing (Australian states)
   - Scale factors for different coverage types (Single, Couple, Family)
   - Risk loading based on age and gender
   - LHC (Lifetime Health Cover) loading
   - Rebate calculations

2. **Business Logic**
   - Base rate calculation with scale factors
   - Direct rate lookup from detailed rate tables
   - Risk rating for individuals/couples
   - Date-effective pricing rules
   - Complex premium adjustments and loadings

3. **Data Management**
   - 5 Excel files containing business rules and rates:
     - ProductRateMaster.xlsx (base rates)
     - ProductRateDetail.xlsx (frequency-specific rates)
     - ScaleFactors.xlsx (coverage multipliers)
     - RiskLoading.xlsx (age/gender adjustments)
     - RebatePercentage.xlsx (discount rates)

4. **User Interface**
   - Clean, professional form for inputting calculation parameters
   - Real-time premium calculations
   - Detailed breakdown of premium components
   - Support for multiple product calculations simultaneously

### **Technical Implementation**
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful design with comprehensive validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and logging
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Testing**: Postman test collections included
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with multi-architecture support

### **Business Context**
This appears to be an Australian health insurance premium calculator, given the state codes (NSW, VIC, QLD, etc.) and the LHC (Lifetime Health Cover) feature, which is specific to the Australian health insurance system.

The application replaces manual premium calculations with an automated, accurate system that can handle complex business rules and provide instant quotes for insurance products.

I would like you to make a small change to the frontend. Now when there are errors, the frontend only shows the error code, for example &quot;Failed to calculate premium: API responded with status: 500&quot;

Can you also include the error message details?

For example:
when the reqest payload is
{
  &quot;effectiveDate&quot;: &quot;2025-06-20&quot;,
  &quot;productCodes&quot;: [&quot;AML&quot;],
  &quot;stateCode&quot;: &quot;T&quot;,
  &quot;scaleCode&quot;: &quot;S&quot;,
  &quot;rateCode&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
  &quot;paymentFrequency&quot;: &quot;yearly&quot;,
  &quot;rebateType&quot;: &quot;RB&quot;,
  &quot;useBaseRate&quot;: true,
  &quot;useRiskRating&quot;: false
}

The error message is 
{
    &quot;error&quot;: &quot;No base rate found for product code AML&quot;
}

It will be good if the user can also see &quot;No base rate found for product code AML&quot; at the frontend UI

---

I'll modify the frontend to display the detailed error message from the API response. The issue is that the current error handling only shows the HTTP status but doesn't extract the actual error message from the response body.

---

Update error handling to extract and display the detailed error message from API response body

---



The change I made extracts the detailed error message from the API response body when there's an error. Now when you get a 500 error with the payload you mentioned, instead of just seeing "Failed to calculate premium: API responded with status: 500", you'll see "Failed to calculate premium: No base rate found for product code AML".

The key changes:
1. When `response.ok` is false, we now parse the response JSON to get the error details
2. We extract the `error` field from the response body if it exists
3. We fall back to the generic status message if parsing fails or no error field exists
4. The detailed error message is then displayed to the user

This provides much more helpful feedback to users when something goes wrong with their premium calculation request.
